I am a technical product manager and machine learning engineer with 7+ years of experience leveraging cutting-edge technologies to build great products. I am passionate about solving complex problems, contributing to open-source software, continuous learning, and fostering meaningful professional relationships.

I hold a M.S. in Applied Data Science from the University of Chicago, a B.S. certificate in Software Development and Programming from the University of California, Berkeley, and a B.A. in History and Political Science from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Iâ€™ve worked across several industries throughout my careers, including tech, finance, academia, and legal.

My current research and development areas include robotic foundation models, computer vision, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and multimodal large language models (MLLM).
