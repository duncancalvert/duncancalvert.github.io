## What is AI Agent Memory
* An agent's "memory" is data that is not provided by the user in their prompt, but is retrieved and appended to the reasoning process via runtime calls. 
* Agent memory encompasses a diverse set of references and can include everything from past user interactions, previous agent actions, external knowledge bases, system prompts, guardrails, etc.
* The additional context and knowledge provided by memory helps the agent to better conceptualize the request, plan, and then answer the user or take an action.

## Long-Term Agent Memory Types
1. **Episodic:** this type of memory contains past agent interactions and agent action logs. For example, if you asked a chatbot to "repeat the last action that it took in a previous session," it could use episodic memory to complete this request.
2. **Semantic:** this type of memory contains any knowledge the agent should have about itself, or any grounding information stored in knowledge bases that the agent has access to. For example, a vector store in a RAG application is semantic memory.
3. **Procedural:** this type of memory contains system information like the system prompt, metadata on available tools, guardrails, etc. It is usually stored and versioned in Git or prompt registry tools.

## Short-Term Agent Memory
* Any of the above long-term memory types that is pulled during runtime is called "short-term memory" or "working memory".
* This short-term memory is added to the user prompt and passed to the LLM with the aim of boosting performance
* Any intermediate reasoning steps/action history of the current session is also considered short-term memory when in-use.
